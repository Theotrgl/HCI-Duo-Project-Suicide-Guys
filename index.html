  <h5> Lee Jun-fan, born on November 27, 1940 and died on July 20, 1973), better known as Bruce Lee, was a Hong Kong American martial artist, actor, director, martial arts instructor and philosopher. The son of Cantonese opera star Lee Hoi-chuen, Lee was born in the Chinatown area of San Francisco, on November 27, 1940, to parents from Hong Kong, and was raised with his family in Kowloon, Hong Kong. He was introduced to the film industry by his father and appeared in several films as a child actor. His early martial arts experience included Wing Chun, tai chi, boxing, and street fighting. Lee moved to the United States at the age of 18 to receive his higher education at the University of Washington in Seattle, it was during this time that he began teaching martial arts, later drawing significant attention at the 1964 Long Beach International Karate Championships. In the 1970s, his Hong Kong and Hollywood-produced films elevated the traditional martial arts film to a new level of popularity and acclaim, sparking a surge of interest in the Chinese nation and Chinese martial arts in the West. The direction and tone of his films dramatically influenced and changed martial arts and martial arts films worldwide.</h5>
